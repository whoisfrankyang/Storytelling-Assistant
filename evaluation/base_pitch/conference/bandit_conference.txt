Abstractâ€”This research fundamentally augments the autonomous robot-assisted feeding paradigm by incorporating an innovative approach for efficient manipulation strategy selection for unfamiliar food items. By reframing the problem within a modified linear contextual bandit framework, we integrate post hoc context gleaned post-action selection, thereby enhancing learning speed whilst mitigating cumulative regret. This approach effectively utilizes multimodal food properties, typically challenging to discern visually, fostering rapid adaptation of the visual model to unseen food items. Experimental results, employing synthetic data, elucidate the amplification of this effect with high-dimensionality context relative to post hoc context or when the post hoc context model is facile to learn. This framework's application to bite acquisition problem substantiates these findings, demonstrating successful procurement of eight previously unseen food types with a 21% reduction in failures across 64 attempts.
