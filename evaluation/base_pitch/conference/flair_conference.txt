Abstract: Enhancing Autonomous Feeding Systems through Long-Horizon Acquisition and Realistic Dish Handling: An Insight into FLAIR

The technical advancement of robot-assisted feeding has the propensity to augment the living standards of mobility-challenged individuals. There is, however, a significant disparity in the capability of existing systems to manage uniform, prescribed meals and real-world, varied culinary presentations. The complexity arises from the multitude of food types and the necessity for tailored manipulation strategies, sequenced over an extended duration to facilitate a complete meal. The optimal assistive feeding system necessitates efficient sequencing of distinctive strategies and the consideration of user-specific preferences. In response, we propose FLAIR, a system designed for long-horizon feeding, integrating foundation models' commonsense and few-shot reasoning capabilities, along with a parameterized skill set, to plan and implement user-centric and proficient bite sequences. In evaluations conducted on 6 realistic plates, FLAIR exhibits adeptness in leveraging a diverse skill set for effective food pickup, aligning with the varied preferences of the 42 non-mobility-challenged participants in our user study. We exemplify FLAIR's seamless integration with existing bite transfer methodologies [19, 28], and its deployment across 2 institutions and 3 robotic systems, highlighting its versatility. Further, we demonstrate FLAIR's real-world applicability successfully feeding a care recipient with severe mobility limitations. Supplementary resources are available at: emprise.cs.cornell.edu/flair.
