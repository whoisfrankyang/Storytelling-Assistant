Abstractâ€”This paper introduces REPeat, an innovative Real2Sim2Real framework, devised to augment bite acquisition in robotic feeding technologies for soft food items. The system implements pre-acquisition maneuvers such as pushing, cutting, and flipping to enhance the efficacy of bite acquisition techniques like skewering, scooping, and twirling. The Real2Sim phase is initiated if the data-driven model forecasts a low likelihood of successful direct bite acquisition. This phase involves the reconstruction of the food item's geometry within a simulation environment. The robot explores a range of pre-acquisition strategies, following which a Sim2Real phase generates a photorealistic rendering to reevaluate prospective success rates. Provided there's an improvement, the robot executes the action in the real world. The system's efficiency has been assessed across 15 varied plates containing 10 distinct soft food items, demonstrating a 27% mean improvement in bite acquisition success rates across all plates.
