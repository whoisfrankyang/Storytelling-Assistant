Abstract: Enhanced Robotic Control through Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Technical Approaches and Contributions

This paper addresses the critical issue of generalization beyond training data in learned robot control policies, with particular emphasis on the utilization of large, internet pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models. We propose the novel application of Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) to VLAs, enabling iterative, complex problem-solving through multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks, motions, and visually grounded features. A scalable pipeline for synthetic training data generation for ECoT on extensive robot datasets is designed, providing robustness and increased generalization capabilities. The research demonstrates a significant 28% enhancement in the success rate of OpenVLA, a leading open-source VLA policy, across challenging generalization tasks, without necessitating additional robot training data. The methodology also facilitates human-interactive policy correction using natural language, and successful transfer of ECoT reasonings to unseen robotic tasks and embodiments.
