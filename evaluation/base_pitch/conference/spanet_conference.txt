Abstract: Technologically Advanced Strategies for Robot-Assisted Feeding: A Comprehensive Analysis on Skewering Actions across Diverse Food Items

This research introduces a novel approach to addressing the complexities inherent in robot-assisted feeding systems, particularly in relation to the acquisition of diverse food items with varying physical properties. We present an in-depth analysis of a dataset consisting of 2450 robotic bite acquisition trials encompassing 16 distinct food items, which has led to insightful discoveries regarding the influence of environmental factors, fork pitch, and fork roll angles on bite acquisition success rates. Our primary contribution lies in the development of a technologically advanced bite acquisition framework, which incorporates an image of a complete plate, segmenting it into individual food items. Our proprietary Skewering-Position-Action Network (SPANet) then identifies optimal food item targets, and determines appropriate skewering strategies to maximize bite acquisition success. Experimental results demonstrate that our integrated system effectively generalizes across both uncluttered and cluttered plates, showcasing the potential of SPANet as a groundbreaking tool in robot-assisted feeding systems.
