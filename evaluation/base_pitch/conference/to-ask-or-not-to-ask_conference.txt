Abstractâ€”This research focuses on enhancing the performance of robot-assisted bite acquisition, a task characterized by a variety of food items with differing shapes, compliance, sizes, and textures. Recognizing the limitations of fully autonomous strategies, we introduce a human-in-the-loop contextual bandit framework, LINUCB-QG. This method incorporates a predictive model that selectively queries for human assistance, thereby managing the workload imposed on the user. The model, trained on data collected from an online study encompassing a diverse participant group, demonstrates superior balance between task performance and querying workload than the autonomous and always-querying baselines. Further validation is provided through experiments involving a simulated food dataset and a user study with 19 participants, including one with severe mobility limitations.
