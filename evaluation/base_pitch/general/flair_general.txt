FLAIR is a new system designed to help people who can't feed themselves due to mobility issues. The existing systems can only handle simple meals, but real-life meals are more diverse and complex. FLAIR is designed to handle a wide variety of food types, knowing how to pick up and serve each one. It also takes into account the person's meal preferences. We tested FLAIR with different food plates and people, and it was able to efficiently serve the meals while respecting everyone's tastes. We've also successfully used FLAIR to feed someone with severe mobility limitations, showing it can make a real difference in people's lives.
