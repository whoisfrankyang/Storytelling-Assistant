This study is about finding the best way to teach computers to solve problems. We tested two methods: one where the computer tries to understand the rules from a few examples, and another where it tries to guess the right answer based on those examples. We found that each method excels in different types of problems. The first method is great for precise calculations and combining different ideas, while the second one works well with less clear, more perceptual concepts. When we combined the two methods, the computer's performance got pretty close to that of a human.
