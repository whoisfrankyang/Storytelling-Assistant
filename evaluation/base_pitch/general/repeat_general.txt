This paper talks about a new system called REPeat that makes it easier for robots to pick up soft foods. This can be very helpful for people who need help eating, like elderly or disabled people. The system uses a sort of practice run where it tries out different ways of picking up the food in a simulation before doing it for real. The goal is to try to avoid messing up the food or dropping it. The system was tested on 15 different dishes with 10 types of soft foods and was able to improve the success rate by 27%.
