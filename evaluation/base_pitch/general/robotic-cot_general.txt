Abstract: Improving How Robots Think and Act

Robots often struggle to do tasks they haven't been trained for. We're looking at how to make them smarter and more adaptable by using models that are good at understanding images and language. These models can help robots to think through problems step-by-step before they act. But, it's not enough for robots to just think about tasks, they also need to understand what they're seeing and their own state. That's why we've developed a new way for robots to think in a more connected, grounded way. This approach has improved the success rate of a popular open-source model by 28% and helps people better understand and correct a robot's mistakes. We've also seen that our model can apply this way of thinking to new tasks and situations.
