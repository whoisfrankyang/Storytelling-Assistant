Summary: We've been working on a robot that can help people eat by picking up different types of food from a plate. It's a bit tricky because all foods are different - some are soft, some are hard and they all come in different shapes and sizes. We've found out that if foods are similar in some way, the robot can use the same method to pick them up. To figure out the best way to do this, we tested the robot on lots of different foods. We used what we learned to make the robot smarter, so it can look at a plate of food, decide what's on it, and pick up each piece in the best way possible. Our tests show that our robot can handle all sorts of food situations!
