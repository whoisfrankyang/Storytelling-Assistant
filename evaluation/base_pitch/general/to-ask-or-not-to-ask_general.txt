This research is about making robots smarter in helping people eat, especially those with movement problems. Robots find it challenging to handle different types of food, so we've taught them to ask people for help when they come across a new kind of food. However, we don't want the robot to bother people too much with questions, so we've created a system that makes the robot ask for help only when it's necessary. We've tested this system with people who have movement problems, therapists, and others. The result? Our smart robot doesn't tire people out with too many questions and is better at helping people eat.
