Discover a revolutionary innovation in robotics: Code as Policies. Harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we've created a system that transforms language commands into robotic policy code. Our cutting-edge technology allows robots to understand and execute complex tasks, displaying spatial-geometric reasoning, adapting to new instructions, and interpreting ambiguous language based on context, thereby opening up vast market opportunities. Our approach has proven to be highly effective, solving 39.8% of problems on a respected benchmark test, outperforming current solutions. Join us as we redefine the future of robotics, unleashing unprecedented business value. More information, including code and videos, is available on our website.
