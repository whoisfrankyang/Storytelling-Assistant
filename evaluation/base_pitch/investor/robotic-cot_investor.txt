Invest in a groundbreaking innovation in robotics that addresses a key weakness in robot control policies - their inability to generalize beyond their training data. Our cutting-edge solution utilizes Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), alongside a new method we call "Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning" (ECoT). ECoT enables robots to think multiple steps ahead, making them more adaptable and robust. Our tests show a stunning 28% success rate improvement over currently available open-source VLA policies, with no need for additional robot training data. Additionally, ECoT simplifies human interaction, making it easier to correct robot behaviour in real-time using natural language. In essence, our technology is creating robots that learn to perform unseen tasks and adapt to new scenarios. Invest now and be a part of this exciting leap in robotics technology.
