Invest in our highly innovative robot-assisted feeding system! We've tackled the challenge of diverse food items by developing a smart strategy that adapts to new foods based on their physical properties. We've leveraged the analysis of 2450 robotic trials on 16 different food items to optimize bite acquisition. This has led to the creation of our unique Skewering-Position-Action network (SPANet) that intelligently chooses target food items and actions to maximize success rates. This framework has been tested on various plates, demonstrating its outstanding ability to generalize. This is not just a groundbreaking tech, but a promising investment with huge market potential!
