Invest in the future of assisted living technology! Our cutting-edge robot-assisted feeding solution is based on the unique concept of "human-in-the-loop bite acquisition." We've developed a smart algorithm that teaches our robot to adapt to different food types. It even knows when to ask for human help, reducing the burden on users. Our system, tested by people with and without mobility issues, proved more efficient and considerate than fully autonomous or always-asking models. The potential market across healthcare and elderly care industries is vast.
