To Ask or Not To Ask: Human-in-the-loop Contextual Bandits with Applications in Robot-Assisted Feeding

Abstractâ€”Robot-assisted bite acquisition involves picking up
food items with varying shapes, compliance, sizes, and textures.
Fully autonomous strategies may not generalize efficiently
across this diversity. We propose leveraging feedback from the
care recipient when encountering novel food items. However,
frequent queries impose a workload on the user. We formulate
human-in-the-loop bite acquisition within a contextual bandit
framework and introduce LINUCB-QG, a method that selectively
asks for help using a predictive model of querying workload
based on query types and timings. This model is trained
on data collected in an online study involving 14 participants
with mobility limitations, 3 occupational therapists simulating
physical limitations, and 89 participants without limitations. We
demonstrate that our method better balances task performance
and querying workload compared to autonomous and alwaysquerying
baselines and adjusts its querying behavior to account
for higher workload in users with mobility limitations. We
validate this through experiments in a simulated food dataset
and a user study with 19 participants, including one with severe
mobility limitations. Please check out our project website at:
