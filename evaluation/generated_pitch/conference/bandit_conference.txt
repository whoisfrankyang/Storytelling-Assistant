'''In autonomous robotic food assistance, identifying and acquiring untrained food types is a challenge. This study introduces a novel approach, leveraging post hoc context from visual and haptic feedback to enhance learning in high-dimensional bandit settings. We innovatively modify the linear contextual bandit framework, integrating post hoc context to accelerate learning and reduce cumulative regret. Experiments on synthetic data validated this approach, particularly effective with large context dimensions and easily learnable post hoc context models. Applied to bite acquisition, the system successfully handled eight new food types with 21% fewer failures in 64 attempts, suggesting potential for improved robotic food assistance.'''
