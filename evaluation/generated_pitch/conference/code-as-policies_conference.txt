'''In this study, we address the challenge of efficiently generating robot policy code from natural language commands by repurposing Large Language Models (LLMs). Our innovative approach, Code as Policies, employs hierarchical code generation to autonomously formulate API calls, demonstrate spatial-geometric reasoning, and provide context-dependent precision in ambiguous descriptions. This method improves state-of-the-art performance by solving 39.8% of problems on the HumanEval benchmark, marking a significant advancement in the field of robotics and machine learning. While our approach has shown promising results, future work will focus on overcoming the constraints of code complexity and further improving the generalization to new instructions.'''
