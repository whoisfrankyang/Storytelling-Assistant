'''We address the challenge of distribution shifts in Interactive Imitation Learning (IL) systems during deployment, previously handled by overconfident mechanisms such as ensemble disagreement or Monte Carlo dropout. We propose a novel uncertainty quantification algorithm, Intermittent Quantile Tracking (IQT), and a robust technique, ConformalDAgger, which actively seeks expert feedback leveraging the capabilities of online conformal prediction. Our solutions maintain coverage guarantees and demonstrate superior performance in both simulated and hardware tests on a 7DOF robotic manipulator. Our study exposes the potential of conformal prediction in IL and invites further exploration in managing intermittent expert feedback and distribution shift.'''
