"Existing robotic feeding solutions struggle with handling diverse, realistic meals which require complex manipulation strategies and user-specific preferences. We propose FLAIR, a novel long-horizon feeding system, which integrates the reasoning capabilities of foundation models and a parameterized skills library for efficient, user-preferred bite sequences. Our real-world evaluations across a variety of food plates and user preferences demonstrate FLAIR's adaptability and efficacy. Despite challenges in handling diverse food types and user preferences, FLAIR's successful deployment on multiple robots and institutions showcases its potential. Future work includes enhancing FLAIR's scalability and exploring its applicability to other assistive tasks."
