"In this paper, we address the challenge of enhancing bite acquisition in robot-assisted feeding for soft foods, a crucial but under-explored area in assistive robotics. We propose REPeat, a novel Real2Sim2Real framework that employs data-driven pre-acquisition actions and simulation-based reinforcement learning. Our approach innovatively integrates 'real-world' and 'simulation' scenarios to maximize success rates. Evaluation on 15 diverse plates with 10 types of soft diet food items demonstrates a significant 27% average improvement in bite acquisition success rates. While our initial results are promising, future work includes refining the data-driven model and extending the application to a wider variety of food items."
