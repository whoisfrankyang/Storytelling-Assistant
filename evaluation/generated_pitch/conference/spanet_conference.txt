"In the realm of robot-assisted feeding, the ability to successfully acquire diverse food items remains a significant challenge due to the wide-ranging physical properties of food items. This study presents a novel solution through the development of a Skewering-Position-Action network (SPANet), devised by analyzing a dataset of 2450 robot bite acquisition trials for 16 food items. The SPANet utilizes the image of a full plate to segment food items and optimize bite acquisition success rates. Despite the challenge of a diverse food environment, results indicate a promising capacity to generalize across food items, paving the way for future enhancements in robot-assisted feeding."
