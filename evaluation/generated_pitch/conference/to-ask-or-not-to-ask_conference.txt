"In the realm of robot-assisted feeding, accommodating diverse food items proves a formidable challenge. This study introduces LINUCB-QG, a unique human-in-the-loop approach within a contextual bandit framework, leveraging user feedback for novel food items while managing query workload. Employing a predictive model trained on diverse participant data, our method balances task performance and querying effort, adjusting for users with mobility limitations. Demonstrated via a simulated food dataset and user study, our approach outperforms autonomous and always-querying baselines. Future work could explore the adaptation of this framework to other robotic assistance applications. Visit our project website at: emprise.cs.cornell.edu/hilbiteacquisition."
