'''Are you familiar with the frustration of teaching a robot to perform a task, only to have it fail when the situation changes slightly? This is a common problem in interactive imitation learning (IL), where we teach robots by showing them how to do tasks. The heart of this project is a new method called "ConformalDAgger", which makes robots smarter and more adaptable. Using a technique called "intermittent quantile tracking", it allows robots to understand when they are uncertain and ask for help. This breakthrough could transform industries, from manufacturing to healthcare, and make robots far more useful in our everyday lives.'''
