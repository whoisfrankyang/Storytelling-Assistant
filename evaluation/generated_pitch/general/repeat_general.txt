"Struggling with eating soft foods is a major issue that affects millions of people worldwide, especially those requiring robot-assisted feeding. To tackle this, we introduce 'REPeat', a unique approach that uses 'pre-acquisition actions' like pushing, cutting, and flipping to increase the success rate of bite acquisitions, such as skewering, scooping, and twirling. Our system even creates a simulation of the food's geometry to explore the best approach for successful bite acquisition. This innovation stands out as it significantly improves bite acquisition success rates by 27% across all plates, making mealtime easier and more enjoyable for countless individuals needing assistance."
