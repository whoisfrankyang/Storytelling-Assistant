"Imagine a world where robots aren't limited by their programmed tasks, where they can reason, adapt, and improve their performance on the fly. That's the vision driving our project. We're tackling a core issue in robotics: robots struggle to handle tasks beyond their training data. This limitation affects industries worldwide, from manufacturing to healthcare, constraining productivity and potential growth. Our innovation? The Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT). It's a breakthrough that teaches robots to reason iteratively, planning and adapting before they act. This isn't just an incremental improvementâ€”it boosts the success rate of the strongest open-source robot policy by a staggering 28%. And it's not just about efficiency. ECoT opens up the possibility for humans to interactively correct a robot's behavior using natural language. The implications are transformative, expanding the potential of robotics across sectors and making the future of work more dynamic and collaborative than ever."
