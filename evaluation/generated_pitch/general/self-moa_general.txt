"Ever wondered how Google or Siri seem to know exactly what you mean? They use Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and respond. Yet, the question is: could they be even better? This project explores that, questioning if blending different LLMs, a method called Mixture-of-Agents (MoA), really adds value. The innovation here is Self-MoA, a new approach that only uses the best-performing LLM, which surprisingly outperforms the traditional method. This research could redefine how our digital assistants work, making them more accurate and efficient, potentially impacting millions of users worldwide. Understanding this could make your virtual interactions even smoother!"
