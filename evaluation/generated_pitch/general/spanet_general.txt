'''Imagine the struggle of those who can't feed themselves due to disability or illness, a problem affecting millions worldwide. Our project addresses this by developing a robotic feeding system capable of adapting to any food item on a plate. Our game-changing innovation, the Skewering-Position-Action network (SPANet), uses the image of a full plate to choose the perfect bite, factoring in food characteristics and surrounding environment. This thoughtful approach sets us apart, making feeding easier and more successful. Our tests show that this solution could revolutionize assisted feeding, bringing independence and dignity back to countless individuals.'''
