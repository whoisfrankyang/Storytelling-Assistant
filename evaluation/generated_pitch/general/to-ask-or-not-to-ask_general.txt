"Imagine the struggle of millions around the world with mobility limitations, especially when it comes to simple daily tasks like eating. Our project, 'To Ask or Not To Ask', addresses this poignant issue with a novel twist. We've developed a robotic aid, LINUCB-QG, that is not just autonomous but smart enough to ask for human help when it encounters unfamiliar food items. The beauty of our innovation is in its balance â€“ it ensures both efficient task performance and reduces the burden on the user by smartly judging when to query. In trials involving 14 participants with mobility limitations, the system demonstrated a marked improvement in autonomy and adaptability. Our solution promises to revolutionize the assistance provided to those with severe mobility limitations, making their daily routines significantly easier.
