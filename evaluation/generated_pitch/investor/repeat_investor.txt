"Millions of people with mobility issues struggle with daily tasks like feeding, with current solutions often failing to handle soft foods. We've developed REPeat, a cutting-edge Real2Sim2Real framework for robot-assisted feeding that uses strategic pre-acquisition actions to ensure successful bite acquisition. Our unique approach involves simulating and testing actions before execution, something competitors don't offer. This gives us a technical edge and makes replication difficult. REPeat's innovative capabilities could transform the lives of millions, and with a potential market in the growing healthcare tech industry, there's immense business potential for monetization.
