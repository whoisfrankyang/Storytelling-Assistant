'''The problem we're addressing is the challenge of robot-assisted feeding, particularly in handling diverse food items with varying physical properties. This issue affects a significant number of elderly and disabled individuals who rely on assistive technologies for daily tasks. Our innovative solution is a robot-assisted feeding system that uses our Skewering-Position-Action network (SPANet), which can adapt to and successfully acquire different food items based on their physical properties. SPANet's technical edge lies in its capacity to learn from a dataset of bite acquisition trials, making it difficult to replicate. This innovation opens up a vast market in the assistive technology sector, offering a high-quality, adaptable solution for an integral daily need.'''
