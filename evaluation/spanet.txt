Robot-Assisted Feeding: Generalizing Skewering Strategies across Food Items on a Plate

Abstract. A robot-assisted feeding system must successfully acquire
many di↵erent food items. A key challenge is the wide variation in the
physical properties of food, demanding diverse acquisition strategies that
are also capable of adapting to previously unseen items. Our key insight
is that items with similar physical properties will exhibit similar success
rates across an action space, allowing the robot to generalize its actions to
previously unseen items. To better understand which skewering strategy
works best for each food item, we collected a dataset of 2450 robot bite
acquisition trials for 16 food items with varying properties. Analyzing
the dataset provided insights into how the food items’ surrounding environment,
fork pitch, and fork roll angles a↵ect bite acquisition success.
We then developed a bite acquisition framework that takes the image of
a full plate as an input, segments it into food items, and then applies
our Skewering-Position-Action network (SPANet) to choose a target food
item and a corresponding action so that the bite acquisition success rate
is maximized. SPANet also uses the surrounding environment features
of food items to predict action success rates. We used this framework
to perform multiple experiments on uncluttered and cluttered plates.
Results indicate that our integrated system can successfully generalize
